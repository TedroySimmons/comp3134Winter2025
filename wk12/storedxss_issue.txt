Problem: Stored XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)

What’s happening:
The website shows stuff from a file (storedxss.txt) right on the page without checking or cleaning it first.

Why it’s bad:
If someone puts something like a <script> tag in that file, it will run when anyone visits the page. This means the attacker can make popups, steal login info, or send people to a different page without them knowing.

How to fix it:
The website should make sure any text from a file is safe before showing it. This can be done using code like htmlspecialchars() in PHP, so it shows the text but doesn’t actually run it.
